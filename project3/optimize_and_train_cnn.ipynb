    "**Answer**: Decreasing the mini-batch size makes the loss print-outs more erratic because there are fewer samples that have been able to propagate back through the network, so each sample has much more of an impact on what the loss value will be. There is an averaging over all samples that takes place, so if all of the samples in a very small mini-batch are predicted successfully, loss will be low, but it will be high if it performs poorly on the mini-batch. The smaller the mini-batch, the greater the chance that there is a skewed distribution of correct and incorrect predictions. \n"
