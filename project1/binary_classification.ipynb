    "How can we determine a \"good\" value of the learning rate that doesn't result in pathological training behavior? Before, we were just guessing / eye-balling it. \n",
    "\n",
    "One common, simple approach is to perform a **grid search** through the parameter space. We select with a lower bound value for the parameter and walk through the parameter space in equal steps until we hit a upper bound value. After the search concludes, we set the parameter value for \"real simulations\" to the value that \"worked best\" according to some criteria we're interested in optimizing during the grid search.\n",
    "\n",
    "**TODO:** Use grid search to find the highest learning rate that still lowers loss as a function of epoch (i.e. below this value, the loss decreases as a function of epoch, above this critical value, loss increases as a function of epoch). Find the value with precision of at least 1e-3 (10^-3). **Write all your code below and the learning rate that you find in the cell below** — do NOT modify the `Adaline` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tips:**\n",
    "- Define lower and upper bound values for the parameter search, informed by your explorations in 3a.\n",
    "- Define a step size at least as small as your starting value. Your simulation shouldn't last more a few seconds.\n",
    "- There is a `set_learning_rate` method\n",
    "- Keep the number of epochs small (e.g. 10) to keep simulation time reasonable\n",
    "- Remember that you are outputting the entire loss history when you execute `fit`.\n"
